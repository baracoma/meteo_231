Again, refer to the [Trigonometric functions found in the ```math``` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#trigonometric-functions).

    "### Why consider spherical coordinates?\n",
    "\n",
    "Spherical coordinates are useful in analyzing systems that have some degree of symmetry about a point, such as the volume of the space inside a domed stadium or wind speeds in a planet’s atmosphere. A sphere that has Cartesian equation  $x^2+y^2+z^2=c^2$ has the simple equation $\\rho=c$ in spherical coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "In geography, latitude and longitude are used to describe locations on Earth’s surface, as shown in the figure below. Although the shape of Earth is not a perfect sphere, we use spherical coordinates to communicate the locations of points on Earth. Let’s assume Earth has the shape of a sphere with radius  $6,371$km. We express angle measures in degrees rather than radians because latitude and longitude are measured in degrees.\n",

    "Let the center of Earth be the center of the sphere, with the ray from the center through the North Pole representing the positive $z$-axis. The prime meridian represents the trace of the surface as it intersects the $xz$-plane. The equator is the trace of the sphere intersecting the $xy$-plane."
