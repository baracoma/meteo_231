    "# Problem 4 (20 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating weather anomalies for another location. In this optional task you get to start from scratch and download the data yourself from NOAA.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What to do\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start by downloading your own data (daily summaries) from the [NOAA Global Summaries of the Day (GSOD)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/metadata/landing-page/bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.ncdc:C00516).\n",
    "    \n",
    "__Alternatively__\n",
    "Download Philippine Weather Data [from github](https://github.com/baracoma/meteo_231/tree/main/probsets/data/archive). Station names are available via this [csv file](https://github.com/baracoma/meteo_231/blob/main/probsets/data/archive/000_filenames.csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Depending on where you downloaded the data you can do the following....\n",
    "\n",
    "- __if from github__: Extract the op.gz file, and then using pandas, read the .op file as if it's a text file.\n",
    "- __if from GSOD__: Using pandas, read the csv file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Calculate the average temperature for `TMAX` or `MAX` and `TMIN` or `MIN` and insert those values into a new column called `TAVG`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Next, you should use the approaches learned during this week and used in Problem 3 to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For your selected station, calculate the average temperature for each month of 1999, 2009, 2019 (see Problem 3). Store this in a new dataframe, and display the first few rows.\n",
    "- Download data for an additional station and then do the previous step for this station (i.e. in a new dataframe).\n",
    "- Now that you have two stations, two different dataframes, three different decades, calculate the temperature differences for the two stations for each decade.\n",
    "- For each station calculate the summaries (TMAX, TMIN, TAVG), per month (Jan - Dec), per year (1999, 2009, 2019) and then save as `CSV` file "
